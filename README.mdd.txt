Movie Recommendation System

 

This project is a machine learning-based application that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences.
This Project is about how to build Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Python. 

Features

User-friendly command-line interface.
Accurate movie recommendations based on user input.
Efficient and scalable cosine similarity algorithm.

This project is built using the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
difflib (part of the Python standard library)
scikit-learn



Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the Movie Recommendation System is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can use any movie dataset with relevant information such as movie titles, descriptions, genres, etc. You can download the dataset from Kaggle .

Algorithm

The Movie Recommendation System uses the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors. It then calculates the cosine similarity between movies based on these vectors to determine their similarity. The higher the cosine similarity score, the more similar the movies are considered to be.
